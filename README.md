# Isazi AI Challenge - Task 1

- For the Isazi AI challenge I have chosen to complete task 1 - Time Series Volume Sales Predictions

## Instructions to Run Notebook

1. Open the following link in a new tab: [Isazi AI Challenge](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maxbrent/IsaziChallenge/blob/master/IsaziAIChallenge_Case_Study_1.ipynb)
  - The following notebook shows my model development, data analysis and training with a **full indepth explanation**
  - You do not have to run this notebook, this is just to show my entire model development process
  - Since a call to a single script needs to be run end-to-end, this is done in the bash script described below

2. Next click on **"Sign IN"** on the top right corner and sign in with your standard google user credentials, or you can use the credentials that I have provided: 
  - **Email**: terminatorxxxcool@gmail.com
  - **Password**: 147369852

3. Once signed in click on the **"Connect"** button on the top right corner and wait for the environment to initialize, once the runtime environment is initialized, you will see a **"Connected"** with a tick in the top right corner.

4. You are now able to run each of the code cells. To run the code cells use **"Shift + Enter"**

5. Some cells will display **cells hidden**. You will need to click on this in the notebook to exapand the cells.

6. All of the dependencies that need to be installed will be installed by running the code cells in the notebook.

7. Additional code that is used in the notebook is provided in this github repository **predictions.py** file.
  - This is used to make the predictions which is executed from a **bash script** [Bash Execution Script in Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maxbrent/IsaziChallenge/blob/master/SingleExecutionScript.ipynb)

8. All of the data used in the notebook is provided in this github repository in the **data** folder.

9. The trained model is stored in the **models** folder along with its checkpoints, **reports** folder stores the generated reports
  
10. Thanks

## NB: I have completed the challenge except for the report generating part due to my lack of time, however I have generated a pdf from a markdown file to show that I am capable of generating the reports
